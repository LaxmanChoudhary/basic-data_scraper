### It's one of the practical application of the python that automates the task
Data scraping, also known as web scraping, is the process of importing information from a website into a spreadsheet or local file saved on your computer. It’s one of the most efficient ways to get data from the web.

Popular uses of data scraping include:
  * Research for web content/business intelligence
  * Pricing for travel booker sites/price comparison sites
  * Finding sales leads/conducting market research by crawling public data sources (e.g. Yell and Twitter)
  * Sending product data from an e-commerce site to another online vendor (e.g. Google Shopping)

And that list’s just scratching the surface. Data scraping has a vast number of applications – it’s useful in just about any case where data needs to be moved from one place to another.

Python uses following libraries for scraping data of the link,
> requests
